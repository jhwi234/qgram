The Y-axis represents the size of the word, while the X-axis represents the position of the missing letter. The values in the table cells are calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the number of predictions made for that specific size and position.

Each row corresponds to a different position of the missing letter, and each column corresponds to a different word size. The word size (number of letters) will limit the number of positions available for the rows. For instance, a word of size four will only have four rows, a word of size five will have five rows, and so on. The maximum word size to be considered is eight.

The value of each cell in the table is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions for that specific word size and missing letter position.
