the rank of `ng` is driven by `ing` not `ng` itself. So the higher order q-grams drive the popularity of the lower order q-grams even though the lower order q-grams are more frequent. This is a general property of q-grams. The higher order q-grams are less frequent but they are more informative. This is why we use higher order q-grams in the first place.

The larger order combinations are driving up the unusual bi grams.

show me all of ing and show me all of Xng (out of an ng three grams what is the ration to all ng three grams to all ing three grams)

How do we do that when you don't know what is driviing the popularlity we assumed ing a priori.

how do these two grams get into the top ten? what are all the three, four, and five conteutualizations in their ranked frequcnyies. for every environment three to six, where that two grams occurs what is the frequency of the thre to six grams.

hypothetical is ht to being driven by ought then ht should be ahead of ght, which should be ahead of ught, which should be ahead of ought. so if the higher order gram is comporabale in freuqncy to the lower order gram than assume that higjher order gram is dominatent enviroment for anything below it.

we know that lower order grams will always be more frequnct that higher order grams that share the same contiguious sequences but the issue is determining how much the higher order grams drive the lower order grams frequcny.

because we're talking types and not lemmas, any word that ends in ing is going to be a new type. `single` is more predictable because of inflectional `ing` but `bangle` is less predictable because of derivational `ing`. 

of the top three qgrams, find which morphemes are driving the popularity of the qgrams.

`the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`
`the fat old cat jumps over the cozy chair`

if my training data only included moprhphemes bound and the testing data only included free content root morphemes could I still predict the missing letters in the testing data? if it the derivational and inflectional morphomogy driving all of this?
